Initital wireframes of my project that I initially built didn't end up becoming my current project lay-out but provided a sense of where I wanted to take my initial html project.

When building my beginning project setup

I went with the roboto font as it gave my project a professional look.
My first idea was to have a looped video which related to the main message of my video.

As we have built video containers before on the HTML Lms. I had used previous knowledge to implement that into the hero of my project. 

I liked the idea of a looped, muted animation that provided a visual message, which complimented the main purpose of the website which is to warn users about phishing.

Styling the video and using chatgpt to assist me, introduced me to the subtle but power styling effect of border-radius: ; which gives the feel of high quality ui, you will see that I consistently implemented around my project. 

I added a hover effect to the navigation links, making the links change color slightly when hovered to enhance interactivity.

The navigation bar is fixed at the top to remain visible as users scroll through the site, providing easy access to all sections.
## Responsive Layout
I used CSS media queries to ensure that each element is responsive, allowing Phishing-Safe to look polished on both mobile and desktop devices. Font sizes, padding, and card layouts adjust automatically to fit different screen sizes, enhancing readability and usability.


## Information Cards Section
The information cards section is designed with a flexible grid layout, which adjusts the number of cards per row based on screen width. This allows the cards to appear well-spaced and readable on both mobile and larger screens.
Each card includes a heading and a brief description, providing concise information on various aspects of phishing awareness. This modular design also makes it easy to add or rearrange content as needed. 

## Resources Section

The Resources section offers links to external guides, best practices, and reporting information, all organized within responsive cards for a consistent look.
Bootstrap’s grid system was leveraged to create a responsive three-column layout, which adjusts to a single-column layout on smaller screens, improving accessibility.
